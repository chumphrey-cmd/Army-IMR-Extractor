# Army Individual Medical Readiness (IMR) Extractor

**IMR Extraction for a Windows 11 Environment**

OVERALL: Serves as my effort to automate the boring stuff associated with Army administrative work. The Army-IMR-Exactor is used to extract fields from single or mutiple IMRs neatly inside of an Excel spreadsheet for all of your tracking needs. 

Pre-requisites:
NOTE: required download to utilize the "import fritz" library to extract bounding box of specific field names.
- Download "Build Tools" for Visual Studio" (https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/visual-cpp-build-tools/)
- Select "Desktop development with C++" workload
- Restart computer

Using the Tool
1. Collect IMRs you wish to extract and place all inside the current directory the Army-IMR-Extractor is located.
2. Run "imr.py" and follow the prompts
   ```shell
   python ./imr.py
   ```
